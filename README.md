# µDroplet - Microfluidics platform

Microfluidics is an area of research based on the manipulation of small fluid volumes on the order of microliters or nanoliters.

µDroplet is an open-source platform with an 8&times;8 array of electrodes driven by a high voltage to expermiment with various microfluidics techniques and materials.
